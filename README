=Intro
All dockerfiles that I created for various learning/work purposes.
In order to build images, first go to the relevant ubuntu version
and then just use the Makefile inside that folder

==Example
If you want to setup a cuda SDK v8.0 image on your system:
```bash
$ cd ubuntu1604
$ make cuda80
```
Just typing a 'make' with no targets will print usage info. Check it out
to know other images which can be built using this flow.

=Pre-reqs
* gpu-enabled system
* docker
* nvidia-docker
* latest cuda driver
* C pre-processor
* GNU-make
