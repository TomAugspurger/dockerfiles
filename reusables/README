This directory contains some of the common commands that can be (re)used by
other Dockerfile's as per their requirements! Ideally, commands that are used
again-and-again in other Dockerfiles in this project will end up here.

Other Dockerfile's can then '#include' file(s) here and use C pre-processor
to expand their contents with commands in these file(s)!

Example usage:
```bash
$ ls
reusables Dockerfile.cpp
$ cat Dockerfile.cpp
FROM ubuntu:16.04
#include "resuables/python-dev-2.7"
$ cpp -o Dockerfile Dockerfile.cpp
$ docker build -t myimage:mytag .
```
