Even though one can get away with a single source file for the cpu-side,
that's not quite possible in the CUDA world!! As soon as a .cu file includes
pybind11.h, nvcc throws up with the following errors:
```
include/pybind11/cast.h(837): error: alias template "pybind11::detail::type_caster_base<type>::cast_op_type" may not be used in the type-id of the alias-declaration
```
The only way I could solve this problem was to split the PYBIND11_MODULE
definition inside a separate .cpp file. If anyone has a better solution,
let me know.
